Given a database of Khan academy user badges, answer some relevant questions regarding the data

View the data:
SELECT * FROM badges;
SELECT date, badge_name, badge_type, energy_points FROM badges ORDER BY date desc

What are the average, maximum, and minimum energy points of the users?
SELECT AVG(energy_points) AS "avg_energy_points" , MAX(energy_points) AS "max_points" ,MIN(energy_points) AS "min_points" FROM badges;

What are those where average and max energy points were greater than 12000
SELECT date, badge_name, badge_type, 
ROUND(AVG(energy_points),2) AS "avg_energy_points", MAX(energy_points) AS "max_points" FROM badges
GROUP BY date
HAVING avg_energy_points > 12000 AND max_points > 12000;

Group the values in a relevant way using CASE
	SELECT date,badge_name, badge_type,
	    CASE
	        WHEN energy_points > 10000-15000 THEN "Within target"
	        WHEN energy_points < 10000 THEN "below target"
	        WHEN energy_points > 15000 THEN "above target"
	        ELSE "not target"
	    END as "target"
	FROM badges
	GROUP BY target;

How can we filter the data?
SELECT badge_type,date, 
MIN (energy_points) = 10000 OR 20000
AND COUNT(*)
FROM badges
GROUP BY badge_type;
