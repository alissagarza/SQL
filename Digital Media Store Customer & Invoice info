In this code, I am answering some questions about Chinook's database, which contains tables of: Customers, Invoice Items, Tracks, Employees, etc. in order to show relevant information about the data.

	1. Show how many orders were placed per country.

	SELECT COUNT(Invoiceid), BillingCountry
	FROM chinook.invoices
	GROUP BY BillingCountry

	2. Which country has the most invoices? 

	SELECT BillingCountry, COUNT(Invoiceid)
	FROM chinook.invoices
	GROUP BY BillingCountry
	ORDER BY COUNT(Invoiceid) desc
	LIMIT 1
	
	3. Show the customers' name and phone number for all the orders placed in Canada.

	SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Phone, invoices.BillingCountry
	FROM chinook.customers
	JOIN chinook.invoices
	ON customers.Customerid = invoices.CustomerId
	WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Canada'
	
	4. Show the invoice details of the order with the highest total in 2010.

	SELECT * 
	FROM chinook.invoices
	WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2010%'
	ORDER BY Total desc
  
	5. Show customers' full names, ids, and country who are not in the US


	SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country 
	FROM chinook.customers
	WHERE Country <> 'USA';
	

	6. Show only customers from Brazil

	SELECT * FROM 
	chinook.customers
	WHERE Country = 'Brazil'
	

	7. Find the invoices from the customers from brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

	SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.invoiceid, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
	FROM chinook.customers as cust
	JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
	ON cust.Customerid=inv.CustomerId
	WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';
	
	
	
	8. Show the employees who are sales agents

	SELECT *
	FROM chinook.employees
	WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
	
	9. Show a unique/ distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table 

	SELECT distinct BillingCountry
	FROM chinook.invoices
	
	10. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent 
	
	SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
	FROM chinook.employees as emp
	JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepID
	JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.Customerid = inv.Customerid
	
	11. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
	
	SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, cust.SupportRepID, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Total, inv.invoiceid

	JOIN chinook.employees as emp
	ON emp.employeeid = cust.SupportRepID
	
	12. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

	SELECT COUNT(Invoiceid)
	FROM chinook.invoices
	WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';
	
	13. What are the total sales for 2009?

	SELECT SUM(Total)
	FROM chinook.invoices
	WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%'
	
	14. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line id.

	SELECT InvoiceLineId, TrackId, Name
	FROM chinook.invoice_items
	JOIN chinook.tracks
	ON invoice_items.Trackid = tracks.TrackId
	
	15. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
 
	SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.TrackId, tracks.Name as track, artists.Name as artist

	ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
	
	17. Show the total sales made by each sales agent 

	SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total),2) as 'total sales'
	FROM chinook.employees 
	JOIN chinook.customers

	JOIN chinook.invoices
	ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
	WHERE employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
	GROUP BY employees.FirstName;
	
	
	18. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
